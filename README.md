<h2>Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach</h2>
<p>The advent of e-news, or electronic news, portals have offered us a great opportunity to quickly get updates on the day-to-day events occurring globally. The information on these portals is retrieved electronically from online databases, processed using a variety of software, and then transmitted to the users. There are multiple advantages of transmitting new electronically, like faster access to the content and the ability to utilize different technologies such as audio, graphics, video, and other interactive elements that are either not being used or arenâ€™t common yet in traditional newspapers.</p>
<p>E-news Express, an online news portal, aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. With every visitor to the website taking certain actions based on their interest, the company plans to analyze these actions to understand user interests and determine how to drive better engagement. The executives at E-news Express are of the opinion that there has been a decline in new monthly subscribers compared to the past year because the current webpage is not designed well enough in terms of the outline & recommended content to keep customers engaged long enough to make a decision to subscribe.</p>
